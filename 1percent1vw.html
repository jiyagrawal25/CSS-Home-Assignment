  <!-- The difference between 1% and 1vw in CSS lies in what they measure and how they behave:

  1% (Percentage)
  Definition: A percentage value is relative to the size of the parent element.
  Usage Context: Depends on the property it is applied to. For example:
  For width or height, 1% is calculated based on the width or height of the parent element.
  For properties like margin, padding, and others, it is relative to the size of the parent element's width unless otherwise specified.
  Dynamic Behavior: Changes as the size of the parent element changes.

  1vw (Viewport Width)
  Definition: 1vw is 1% of the width of the entire viewport (the browser window or device screen).
  Usage Context: It is independent of the parent element and always refers to the viewport size.
  Dynamic Behavior: Changes when the size of the viewport (browser window) changes.-->
